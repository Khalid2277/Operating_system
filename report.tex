\section{Design Decisions}

\subsection{Synchronization Strategy}

Our implementation uses semaphores and mutexes to ensure thread-safe access to the shared buffer and prevent race conditions.

\textbf{Semaphores for Buffer Management:} We use three semaphores for synchronization. The \texttt{mutex} semaphore (initialized to 1) provides mutual exclusion for critical sections. The \texttt{empty} semaphore (initialized to buffer size) tracks available slots and blocks producers when the buffer is full. The \texttt{full} semaphore (initialized to 0) tracks occupied slots and blocks consumers when the buffer is empty. This approach eliminates busy-waiting, as threads block efficiently on semaphore operations.

\textbf{Critical Section Protection:} The \texttt{mutex} semaphore protects the buffer during insertion and removal operations, ensuring only one thread modifies the buffer at a time. A separate \texttt{stats\_lock} mutex protects shared statistics counters to prevent race conditions during metric updates.

\textbf{Rationale:} This synchronization strategy prevents overflow/underflow conditions, data corruption, and race conditions without busy-waiting or inefficient polling mechanisms.

\subsection{Circular Buffer Implementation}

The buffer uses a dynamically allocated array with \texttt{in} and \texttt{out} indices that wrap around using modulo arithmetic: \texttt{(index + 1) \% buffer\_size}. The \texttt{in} index points to where the next item will be inserted (producer), and \texttt{out} points to where the next item will be removed (consumer).

\textbf{Rationale:} Circular buffers maximize memory efficiency by reusing array slots. The modulo operation handles wrapping automatically, enabling continuous operation without memory reallocation.

\subsection{Priority Handling (Bonus Feature)}

Each buffer item contains a priority field (0=normal, 1=urgent). Priority handling is implemented on the consumer side in the \texttt{remove\_item()} function. When removing an item, the function scans the buffer from \texttt{out} to \texttt{in} to locate urgent items. If an urgent item is found, it is extracted and the items before it are shifted backward to fill the gap. If no urgent items exist, normal FIFO removal occurs. This ensures urgent items are always consumed before later-enqueued normal items while maintaining FIFO order within each priority level.

\textbf{Rationale:} Implementing priority on the consumer side is safer than on the producer side because consumers perform one atomic scan-and-remove operation, avoiding complex circular buffer manipulation during insertion. The shifting operation, performed within the mutex-protected critical section, ensures atomicity and prevents race conditions. Approximately 25\% of items are marked urgent via random probability checking.

\subsection{Poison Pill Termination}

After all producer threads complete and are joined, the main thread inserts one poison pill (special value $-1$) per consumer into the buffer. Upon receiving a poison pill, each consumer terminates its loop gracefully. Poison pills are marked with urgent priority to ensure immediate processing.

\textbf{Rationale:} This technique guarantees that consumers don't exit prematurely while producers are still active, and ensures all real items are consumed before termination. It provides clean, deterministic shutdown without polling or timeout mechanisms.

\subsection{Performance Metrics (Bonus Feature)}

Each item records an enqueue timestamp using \texttt{gettimeofday()} when produced. Consumers record dequeue timestamps upon removal, calculating latency as the difference. Average latency and throughput (items/second) are computed and displayed after all threads complete.

\textbf{Rationale:} These metrics provide quantitative insight into system performance, demonstrating how buffer size affects contention, latency, and throughput. Microsecond-precision timestamps enable meaningful measurements even for fast operations.

\section{Challenges and Solutions}

\subsection{Challenge 1: Priority Queue in Circular Buffer}

\textbf{Problem:} Implementing priority handling in a circular buffer is challenging because standard circular buffers follow strict FIFO ordering. We needed to maintain FIFO within each priority level while allowing urgent items to bypass normal items.

\textbf{Solution:} We implemented priority handling on the consumer side in the \texttt{remove\_item()} function. The function scans forward from the \texttt{out} position to locate the first urgent item. If found, that item is extracted, and items before it are shifted backward to fill the gap. This approach is safer than insertion-time shifting because it avoids complex circular buffer manipulation during producer operations.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Priority Removal Logic}, captionpos=b]
// Scan buffer for urgent items
int urgent_pos = -1;
int pos = out;

while (pos != in) {
    if (buffer[pos].priority == 1 && urgent_pos == -1) {
        urgent_pos = pos;  // Found first urgent item
        break;
    }
    pos = (pos + 1) % buffer_size;
}

// If urgent found, extract and shift backward
// Otherwise, normal FIFO removal
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Challenge 2: Race Conditions in Statistics}

\textbf{Problem:} Multiple threads concurrently updating shared counters (\texttt{total\_produced}, \texttt{total\_consumed}, \texttt{total\_latency}) could cause race conditions and incorrect counts.

\textbf{Solution:} We introduced a separate \texttt{stats\_lock} mutex specifically for protecting statistics updates. This prevents contention with the main buffer semaphore and allows statistics updates to occur independently.

\subsection{Challenge 3: Thread-Safe Random Number Generation}

\textbf{Problem:} The standard \texttt{rand()} function uses shared state and is not thread-safe, potentially causing race conditions when called from multiple producer threads.

\textbf{Solution:} We use \texttt{rand\_r()} with per-thread seeds: \texttt{unsigned int seed = time(NULL) + producer\_id}. This allows each thread to maintain its own random state without shared state or locking overhead.

\subsection{Challenge 4: Memory Management}

\textbf{Problem:} Dynamic memory allocation for thread IDs, buffers, and latency arrays requires careful management to avoid memory leaks.

\textbf{Solution:} We allocate thread IDs in main, pass them to thread functions, and free them immediately after use inside each thread. Buffers and arrays are allocated during initialization and freed in a dedicated cleanup function called at program termination.

\subsection{Challenge 5: Poison Pill Timing}

\textbf{Problem:} Ensuring poison pills are inserted only after all real items have been produced, and that each consumer receives exactly one poison pill.

\textbf{Solution:} The main thread joins all producer threads before inserting poison pills, guaranteeing no more real items will be produced. We insert exactly \texttt{num\_consumers} poison pills, and consumers track them separately from real items.

\section{Performance Analysis}

We tested the application with varying buffer sizes to observe performance characteristics:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Performance Metrics for Different Buffer Sizes}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Buffer Size} & \textbf{Avg Latency (sec)} & \textbf{Throughput (items/sec)} \\ \midrule
8P, 8C & 2 & $\sim$0.000065 & $\sim$20,000 \\
8P, 8C & 32 & $\sim$0.000020 & $\sim$50,000 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Interpretation:} Small buffers (2 slots) create high contention, causing frequent blocking and increased latency. Producers often wait for space, and consumers wait for data, reducing throughput. Larger buffers (32 slots) reduce contention significantly, allowing more concurrent operations. Producers can insert multiple items before blocking, and consumers have items readily available, resulting in 2.5× higher throughput and 3× lower latency. This demonstrates the critical impact of buffer sizing on concurrent system performance.

\section{Testing and Verification}

The application was rigorously tested with various configurations:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Correctness:} Verified that total items produced equals total items consumed for all test cases
    \item \textbf{Priority Handling:} Confirmed through output logs that urgent items are consistently consumed before later-enqueued normal items
    \item \textbf{Concurrency:} Tested with up to 20 threads (10 producers, 10 consumers) without deadlocks or data corruption
    \item \textbf{Edge Cases:} Single thread (1P, 1C), minimal buffer (size 1), and large configurations all operate correctly
    \item \textbf{Memory Safety:} No memory leaks detected in validation testing
\end{itemize}
